# Apka

This is a project basing on Solito library by Fernando Rojo.
I left the readme of the Solito starter project [here](docs/SOLITO.md)

## Goal

The goal of this project is to learn expo & next.js, and try to build an app using monorepo.
I want to create a copy of one board game, that i have received.

## Installation

Everything is described [here](docs/SOLITO.md). All I can add is that you should make sure that you have expo-cli and yarn package manager installed.

## Development

All current issues are described inside github issues tab.
To resolve any, please, checkout to a nwe branch from develop, solve it and create a merge request onto develop
